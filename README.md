# IPL-Win-Probability-Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts the **win probability of IPL teams** based on real-time match conditions using historical IPL data.

---

## Overview
This project uses **supervised machine learning** to estimate a team’s chances of winning during an IPL match by analyzing key match features such as runs, wickets, overs, and target score.

---

## Technology used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn    
- VS Code
